Analyze the attached photo and return a JSON object with detected ingredients. Follow these rules exactly:

1. Output format
Return only a single JSON object (no surrounding text).
The object must match the schema described below. Any deviation will be considered invalid.

2. What counts as an ingredient
Include edible items actually visible or clearly listed on packaging in the photo (e.g., tomatoes, olive oil, sugar, wheat flour).
If a package’s printed ingredient list is visible, parse that list and return its items.
Exclude non-food objects (utensils, plates, labels that are not ingredients, logos, brand names) unless the brand name is itself a food ingredient (rare).

3. Normalization rules
name must be the common, singular, lowercase English name (e.g., "tomato", "egg", "brown sugar").
Remove adjectives that are not essential to identify the ingredient (e.g., "fresh", "ripe") — but preserve meaningful qualifiers (e.g., "ground black pepper", "unsalted butter").
Deduplicate synonyms: if the same ingredient appears with synonyms, merge into one entry and list synonyms in aliases.

4. The output must contain each ingredient only once. 
Never repeat the same ingredient. 
If the model starts repeating, stop immediately and finalize the JSON.
